## Boat Jump Calculator

This calculator helps you determine the precise timing for boat jumps during the Quillon boss fight. It automates the calculation steps after you've noted down the initial timer value.

### How to Use

Follow these steps to use the boat jump calculator:

1. **Phase Quillon** to 75% or 25% HP
2. **Deploy and undeploy an operator** that takes longer than 40s to redeploy (this starts the timer)
3. **Wait for the yellow line** that indicates boat pathing to appear on the map
4. **Pause** once the yellow line reaches the blue box
5. **Frame advance** until the boat information appears on the top right
6. **Frame advance 1 more frame** after boat info appears
7. **Note the exact timer value** (e.g., 65.5) - this is your "initial time"
8. **Frame advance** until the timer changes (e.g., 65.5 → 65.4) and count how many frame advances it took
9. **Enter the values below** along with your relics/conditions
